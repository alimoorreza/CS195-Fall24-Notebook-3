# CS195-Fall24-Notebook-3
## Underwater Animal Classification

<b>Due</b>: Wednesday, October 2nd, 2024

For this assignment, you'll be using the `underwater animal dataset (uws_v1)` that's been provided. You can also find it on Blackboard for the CS195 course. This is a multi-class classification task, which means it involves sorting different types of underwater animals like *dolphins, polar bears, turtles, sharks,* and *whales*. Your goal is to train a deep neural network using this dataset, so it can predict which species an animal belongs to when given a new image.

Notebook:
You should use this [_Notebook_3_starter notebook_](https://github.com/alimoorreza/CS195-Fall24-Notebook-3/blob/main/notebook3_starter.ipynb). It contains the most crucial part, i.e., the code for three CNNs: AlexNet, VGGNet, and ResNet. 
<!--For other machine learning functions, you can borrow them from previous notebooks, such as [CNN finetuning](https://github.com/alimoorreza/CS167-fall24-notes/blob/main/cs195_cnn_finetuning.ipynb).-->
